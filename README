This is a fork of Quercus/PHP, which has been developed by Caucho Technology,
Inc.  The intiial source code was taken from the revison 5460 of the Quercus
subersion repository and resin 4.0 snapshot (4/9/2009).

The source code was heavily patched to reduce dependencies between components
so that it could run on Google App Engine. Therefore, several features such as
content cache and session management doesn't work at the moment, and needs lots
of fixes.

Please note that Caucho Technology has nothing to do with this project,
so please don't direct your questions to them.
